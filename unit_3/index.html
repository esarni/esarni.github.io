<h1>GRAPHIC DESIGNER &amp; PRODUCTION ARTIST</h1>
<h2><i>It takes guts to design.</i></h2>
<p>Born and raised in Southern California, I became captivated with <br> the way shapes, colors, and typography entrance me. I enjoy creating <br> and collaborating; throwing ideas off of one another like a swift and oddly pleasing <br> game of ping-pong is the good stuff. I specialize in print collateral and all things graphic design. <br>However, my leisurely pursuits do not stop there. Below you can find a postiively <br>vague yet eclectic list of what I'm decently good at. Odds are if you need <br>creative assistance, I can do it and I can do it well. <br>Take a gander and shoot me an email.<p>
