<h1>GRAPHIC DESIGNER &amp; PRODUCTION ARTIST</h1>
<h2><i>It takes guts to design.</i></h2>

<p class="aboutme">Born and raised in Southern California, I became captivated with the way shapes, colors, and typography entrance me. <br> I enjoy  creating and collaborating; throwing ideas off of one another like a swift and oddly pleasing game of ping-pong. That's the good stuff.
<br>
<br>I specialize in print collateral and all things graphic design. However, my leisurely pursuits do not stop there. <br> To the right can find a postiively vague yet eclectic list of what I'm decently good at. Odds are if you need creative assistance, <br> I can do it and I can do it well. Take a gander and shoot me an email.</p><
