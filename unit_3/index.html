<p class="about me">Born and raised in Southern California, I became captivated with <br> the way shapes, colors, and typography entrance me. I enjoy <br> creating and collaborating; throwing ideas off of one another like <br>a swift and oddly pleasing game of ping-pong. That's the good stuff.

<br>I specialize in print collateral and all things graphic design. <br>However, my leisurely pursuits do not stop there. Below you <br>can find a postiively vague yet eclectic list of what I'm decently good at.<br> Odds are if you need creative assistance, I can do it and I can do it well. <br>Take a gander and shoot me an email.</p>
